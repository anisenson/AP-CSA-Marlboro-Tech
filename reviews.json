        "Review": "Mrs. Rehwinkel’s AP CSA class is a fantastic introduction to computer science. Her deep knowledge and supportive teaching style made learning Java both fun and engaging. Beyond coding, she really helped me think and solve problems the way a computer scientist would—an approach that’s useful in almost every field. I highly recommend this class to anyone even slightly interested in tech or problem-solving."

        "Review": "AP Computer Science A is a pretty good class if you want to learn coding, especially in Java. It teaches you the basics of programming, like how to use loops, methods, and classes. It also helps with problem-solving and logical thinking, which is useful for other subjects too. Overall, it’s a good class for learning the basics of coding, but it’s not the most exciting or hands-on course out there"
